# Pacman-in-Processing

A simple custom version of Pacman developed in Processing.

Developed by:

- André Ribeiro Martins Marques Mourato
- José Diogo Xavier Monteiro

Introduction

This is a custom version of Pacman, with major changes in terms of gameplay.

Objective

Just like the original Pacman, the objective of this game is to eat all the eggs, avoiding the ghosts.
You may eat the Specials Eggs which are eggs from different colors, that will grant specials abilities to your pacman.

Abilities

Invert: Unlike other abilities, this one is toggled when you touch a red egg. It inverts the trajectory of the red and blue ghost and the map turns red.
SpeedUp: This ability is activated when you eat the green egg. The whole game turns fast-paced temporarily. Pacman gains super-speed, just like the ghosts.
Godmode: This ability is activated when you eat the purple egg. Just like the SpeedUp event, this is a timed ability.
Pacman will become temporarily invulnerable, being able to clip through ghosts (without dying) while it's in Godmode.

Controls

Up Arrow: (well, you guessed it...) Pacman moves Up;
Down Arrow: Pacman moves Down;
Right Arrow: Pacman moves to the Right;
Left Arrow: Pacman move to the Left;
'm' button: Turn the sound ON/OFF;
'Spacebar': Pauses the game;

Credits

Personal Note

I'm still a beginner in programming so please excuse any bugs that you may come across. Feel free to share them with me. :D
